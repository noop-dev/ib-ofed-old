/****h* Component Library/Performance Counters
* NAME
*	Performance Counters
*
* DESCRIPTION
*	The performance counters allows timing operations to benchmark
*	software performance and help identify potential bottlenecks.
*
*	All performance counters are NULL macros when disabled, preventing them
*	from adversly affecting performance in builds where the counters are not
*	used.
*
*	Each counter records elapsed time in micro-seconds, minimum time elapsed,
*	and total number of samples.
*
*	Each counter is independently protected by a spinlock, allowing use of
*	the counters in multi-processor environments.
*
*	The impact of serializing access to performance counters is measured,
*	allowing measurements to be corrected as necessary.
*
* NOTES
*	Performance counters do impact performance, and should only be enabled
*	when gathering data.  Counters can be enabled or disabled on a per-user
*	basis at compile time.  To enable the counters, users should define
*	the PERF_TRACK_ON keyword before including the cl_perf.h file.
*	Undefining the PERF_TRACK_ON keyword disables the performance counters.
*	When disabled, all performance tracking calls resolve to no-ops.
*
*	When using performance counters, it is the user's responsibility to
*	maintain the counter indexes.  It is recomended that users define an
*	enumerated type to use for counter indexes.  It improves readability
*	and simplifies maintenance by reducing the work necessary in managing
*	the counter indexes.
*
