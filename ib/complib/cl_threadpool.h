/****h* Component Library/Thread Pool
* NAME
*	Thread Pool
*
* DESCRIPTION
*	The Thread Pool manages a user specified number of threads.
*
*	Each thread in the thread pool waits for a user initiated signal before
*	invoking a user specified callback function. All threads in the thread
*	pool invoke the same callback function.
*
*	The thread pool functions operate on a cl_thread_pool_t structure which
*	should be treated as opaque, and should be manipulated only through the
*	provided functions.
*
* SEE ALSO
*	Structures:
*		cl_thread_pool_t
*
*	Initialization:
*		cl_thread_pool_construct, cl_thread_pool_init, cl_thread_pool_destroy
*
*	Manipulation
*		cl_thread_pool_signal
