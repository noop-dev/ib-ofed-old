/****h* Component Library/Asynchronous Processor
* NAME
*	Asynchronous Processor
*
* DESCRIPTION
*	The asynchronous processor provides threads for executing queued callbacks.
*
*	The threads in the asynchronous processor wait for callbacks to be queued.
*
*	The asynchronous processor functions operate on a cl_async_proc_t structure
*	which should be treated as opaque and manipulated only through the provided
*	functions.
*
* SEE ALSO
*	Structures:
*		cl_async_proc_t, cl_async_proc_item_t
*
*	Initialization:
*		cl_async_proc_construct, cl_async_proc_init, cl_async_proc_destroy
*
*	Manipulation:
*		cl_async_proc_queue
